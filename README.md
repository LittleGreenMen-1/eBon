# eBon

eBon represents the digital portal of all the receipts that we are using during our everyday life. 
Our main aim is to digitalize receipts, to offer customers a more technological experience in the stores and to help the environment during the process.

## Features
Our project is divided into 2 main categories:
  - software 
  - hardware

In terms of software, we built a **Flutter application** (which is available for Android / iOS / Web). 

And in terms of hardware, we used a **Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)** with a mobile phone that is used as a display for the Raspberry Pi. 

#### Status quo 
At this moment, during the UniHack 2021 weekend, we were able to create this app for the Romanian stores market. What does this mean ? 

Basically our project can be implemented just in Romania Right now. 

If this project is able to survive, we really believe that if we are able to gather more stores from all over the world, eBon can be implemented anywhere.

#### Integration
eBon has a quick integration in the infrastructure of stores (it's very easy to 'plug and play') and it does not require a lot from the customers. 

The general checkout system can look like this:

#### The choice
eBon still offers the customers the posibily to receive clasic receipts. The customer has always the choice between classic receipts or the digital form of them.

What is cool about eBon is that even if a person does not have our app installed, he/she can stil scan the QR code and download the receipt as PDF file. 


## Behind eBon

#### Hardware 
We realised that integrating eBon as a useful solution for the market requires an efficient and affordable way.

Instead of build our own checkout, we wanted to create a device that can work exactly as a thermal printer, so this is where eBox comes to our attention.

eBox is basically a Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM) connected to a phone that is used as a display.

##### The 3D printing story
We wanted to do the eBox as beautiful as we can. We developed a 3D model for the eBox case, but unfortunately we were not able to print all the pieces that we needed. 

Here's a look how our case should have looked like:

## About us 
This project was developed during **UniHack 2021**. All of this was created created by 3 highschool studens from the *"Grigore Moisil" Highschool* from Timisoara, Romania:
- Mihai Albu, 12th grade
- Sirbu Andrei, 12th grade
- Vlad Tomici, 10th grade
