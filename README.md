# eBon

eBon represents the digital portal of all the receipts that we are using during our everyday life. 
Our main aim is to digitalize receipts, to offer customers a more technological experience in the stores and to help the environment during the process.


## Features
Our project is divided into 2 main categories:
  - software 
  - hardware

In terms of software, we built a **Flutter application** (which is available for Android / iOS / Web). 

And in terms of hardware, we used a **Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)** with a mobile phone that is used as a display for the Raspberry Pi. 

eBon has a quick integration in the infrastructure of stores (it's very easy to 'plug and play') and it does not require a lot from the customers. Also, eBon still offers the customers the posibily to receive clasic receipts.
